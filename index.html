<p>
I recently encountered a rendering engine that does so much right
that the things that are wrong with it are getting accepted as 
"the ways that should be." </p>

<p>I am attempting to address these things in the code of SNAPS (&quot;Synapse&quot;)
and show how easy it is to do things right. </p>

<a name="1-total-dom-control" class="anchor" href="#1-total-dom-control">
<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>1: Total DOM control</h2>

<p>Instead of having widgets which seem like they are ashamed of the DOM, 
SNAPS embraces DOM wholly by allowing you to fully access and set all parts 
of a DomElement (attributes, styles, content),
not just a subset of "Blessed" attributes and properties. 
  
  This means for instance that you yourself have a choice of whether to exclude 
  early-generation browsers or bottleneck users to the A-list browsers. 
</p>

<h2>
<a name="2-embracing-polyglot-programming" class="anchor" href="#2-embracing-polyglot-programming">
<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>2: Embracing polyglot programming</h2>

<p>Instead of using fully customized physics, 3D and event systems, 
Snaps uses proven, available engines like THREE, Box2D and Signal. 
This keeps standard systems as part of the frame, and doesn't bloat 
itself with reinventions of problems that are largely solved.</p>

<h2>
<a name="3-designed-for-threading" class="anchor" href="#3-designed-for-threading">
<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>3: Designed for Threading</h2>

<p>Snaps is designed to enable easy export of data across the net, or threads, 
to take advantage of the emerging goodness of WebWorkers. </p>

<h2>
<a name="4-a-broad-open-network-of-shared-components" class="anchor" href="#4-a-broad-open-network-of-shared-components">
<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>4: A broad, open network of shared components</h2>

<p>Snaps uses a collection of Snap instances connected with links to 
form complex patterns that allow intercommunication. Specialized Snap 
inheritors can manage DOM interactions,
or take on simple tasks like managing the size of DOM elements. </p>

<p>Snap instances can be linked in parent child, semantic links,
open graphs and sets, to allow any sort of structure you may need;
for instance, you can set a row height Snap as the resource
link of several different Snap's, and a column width Snap as the
resource link of several different Snap's, to enable a grid pattern. </p>

<p>While this pattern was created to enable DOM management,
it can be used to manage any number of graph/property/semantic problems. </p>

<h2>
<a name="5-synchronized-updates" class="anchor" href="#5-synchronized-updates">
<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>5: Synchronized updates</h2>

<p>As part of the optimization process for distributed work,
all of the updating of data is synchronized by a global
<code>update()</code> call, allowing a gated output of data to a remote system. </p>
